# OnlineCharitySystem

#Give Hope Foundations Objective:
  This charity management is a non-profit organizational system in which non-governmental organisations and donors
can come in and request and donate funds and materials such as cloths, hospital equipment, etc. These objectives are creating online payment, creating login and register
page, appointment booking, allowing users to cancel appointments and even letting them go through the funding and other donation system.
